# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to oni! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

* **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
* **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
* **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...
* **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
* **Money**: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/oni).

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

A PR requires approval for either the maintainer, or a collaborator.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/oni).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

### Bounties

The primary allotment of our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/oni) budget is dedicated to bounties. Developing features and fixing bugs is a loit of work, and those go directly to the developers doing this work via bounties. It is the role of the _maintainer_ to set bounties and clear completion criteria. Issues that have a bounty associated with them will have a `bounty` label as well as an amount, ie, `bounty-50` means a $50 bounty.

* Guidelines:
    * The fix for the bug/feature/issue _MUST_ be complete and _MUST_ be covered by tests to be eligible for a bounty.
    * If you begin working on an issue with an associated bounty, open a PR with "WIP" and the bug number in the title, as well as reference the issue #. This is important to reduce duplicate work.
    * Upon completion, bounties are payable via an [open collective expense].

If you questions about the guidelines, please don't hesitate to contact the maintainer.

## Roles

There are various roles and responsibilities in managing an open-source project. Users that are active and have a positive impact on the project and community will be recognized and have the option of assuming additional responsibilities.

* **Maintainer** - A maintainer communicates goals and drives the vision for the project. The maintainer is responsible for breaking down hurdles and supporting contributors. In addition, the maintainer triages issues, produces releases, assigns bounties, and establishes completion criteria. Today, there is one maintainer, but that isn't a strict requirement.
* **Collaborator** - A collaborator is an established member of the project that is recognized for their impact and contributions. They can triage and close issues, approve PRs from other contributors / collaborators, and can approve expenses on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/oni)
* **Contributor** - A contributor is a developer that has submitted a successful PR for the project.

### Becoming a collaborator

A collaborator is a contributor who has been recognized for the impact they've had on the project, over a sustained period of time. In general, this means the following:

* **Supporting the community** - helping others in issues and chat, supporting new developers, creating a positive and supportive environment.
* **Technical impact** - involvement in a core technical piece of the editor, or a broad impact on the ecosystem.
* **Positive and collaborative mindset** - creating good vibes, willingness to give and receive constructive feedback, being a team player.

## Questions

If you have any questions, create an [issue](issue) (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).
