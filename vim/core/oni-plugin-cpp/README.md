# oni-language-cpp

## C++ Language Plugin for [Oni](https://github.com/extr0py/oni)

C++ support for Oni uses the [clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html) which provides language capabilities for C and C++.

## Usage

To get started:

- Get a working `clangd` (both code and executables are available [here](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html))
- Make sure that `clangd` is available globally (for instance, by adding it to an environment variable)
